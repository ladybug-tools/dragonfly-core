Welcome to Dragonfly's documentation!
=========================================

Dragonfly is a collection of Python libraries to create representations of buildings
following `dragonfly-schema <https://github.com/ladybug-tools/dragonfly-schema/wiki>`_.
It abstracts the capabilities of `honeybee-core <https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-core/>`_
to make it easier to construct models on the urban scale.


Installation
============

To install the core library use ``pip install -U dragonfly-core``.

If you want to also include the command line interface use ``pip install -U dragonfly-core[cli]``.

To check if the Dragonfly command line is installed correctly use ``dragonfly viz`` and you
should get a ``viiiiiiiiiiiiizzzzzzzzz!`` back in response!


Documentation
=============

This document includes `Dragonfly API documentation <#dragonfly>`_ and 
`Dragonfly Command Line Interface <#id1>`_ documentation for ``dragonfly core`` and does
