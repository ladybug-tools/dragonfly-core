    """A complete Building defined by Stories (and optional extra 3D rooms).

    Buildings must have at least one dragonfly Story or one Honeybee Room under
    the room_3ds property.

    Args:
        identifier: Text string for a unique Building ID. Must be < 100 characters
            and not contain any spaces or special characters.
        unique_stories: An array of unique Dragonfly Story objects that
            together form the entire building. Stories input here can be in any
            order but they will be automatically sorted from lowest floor to
            highest floor when they are assigned to the Building. Note that,
            if a given Story is repeated several times over the height of the
            Building, the unique Story included in this list should be the
            first (lowest) Story of the repeated floors. (Default: None).
        room_3ds: An optional array of 3D Honeybee Room objects for additional
            Rooms that are a part of the Building but are not represented within
            the unique_stories. This is useful when there are parts of the Building
            geometry that cannot easily be represented with the extruded floor
            plate and sloped roof assumptions that underlie Dragonfly Room2Ds
            and RoofSpecification. Cases where this input is most useful include
            sloped walls and certain types of domed roofs that become tedious to
            implement with RoofSpecification. Matching the Honeybee Room.story
            property to the Dragonfly Story.display_name of an object within the
            unique_stories will effectively place the Honeybee Room on that Story
            for the purposes of floor_area, exterior_wall_area, etc. However, note
            that the Honeybee Room.multiplier property takes precedence over
            whatever multiplier is assigned to the Dragonfly Story that the
            Room.story may reference. (Default: None).
